# Task: Create a CSS Art Gallery

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Points:** 150  
**Category:** Experimental Project / Visual Creativity  

### 🎯 Goal
Build a visually engaging gallery that displays CSS-only artwork submitted by contributors.  
Each artwork will be represented as an interactive card in a responsive grid layout.

### ✔ Requirements
- Build a grid-based gallery page (`ArtGallery.tsx`)
- Each “art card” should display:
  - Title
  - Creator name
  - A CSS-only art preview (from mock data)
- Add simple hover effects (scale, shadow, rotate, glow — your choice)
- Use animations or transitions in CSS
- Desktop & mobile responsive
- Pull preview data from `mock-art-data.ts`

### 🎨 CSS-Only Art?
Examples of allowed artwork:
- pure CSS shapes  
- gradients  
- animations  
- pixel art with box-shadow  
- neon glow text  
- CSS drawings  
- CSS flags  
No images. No canvases. No libraries.

This encourages creative UI contributions.
